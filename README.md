Sustainable Urban Transport Database Management System

Abstract:
The Sustainable Transport Database Management System is an innovative tool designed to
assist both travellers and city dwellers in finding the most environmentally friendly transport
options (carpools and charging stations e.g.). This comprehensive platform merges an
easy-to-use interface, a dynamic database, and a sophisticated algorithm to provide detailed
insights into eco-friendly transport modes and their impact on the environment. By
harnessing real-time data from various sources, it encourages the adoption of sustainable
transportation methods while aiding users in making informed choices that contribute to a
greener future.

Problem Definition:
● Lack of comprehensive information:
  ○ Existing transportation apps lack a unified platform for sustainable transport
info.
  ○ Users need multiple apps for comprehensive data.
● Environmental unawareness:
  ○ Current systems lack categorization based on environmental impact.
  ○ Users lack awareness of ecological consequences.
● Inefficient recommendation systems:
  ○  Current systems don&#39;t consider real-time weather conditions.
  ○ Suboptimal suggestions during adverse weather.
● Insufficient data on charging points:
  ○ EV-focused systems lack charging point info along user routes.

Functionalities

1. Facts : This functionality aims to provide users with factual information on carbon
emissions and fuel savings associated with different transportation modes. Users can
access informative content highlighting the environmental impact of their
transportation choices, fostering awareness and informed decision-making.

2. Price/Time Comparison between Transport Modes: Users can compare the price
and time factors associated with various transport modes. This functionality allows
users to make cost-effective and time-efficient decisions based on their preferences,
considering factors such as public transportation fares, ride-sharing costs, and travel
durations.

3. Recommendation System According to User : The recommendation system
analyzes user inputs, such as location, destination, and environmental preferences, to
suggest the most sustainable transportation options for their journey. The system
tailors suggestions based on individual user profiles and real-time data, promoting
environmentally conscious choices.

4. Favorite Points (Commonly Used Locations of Travel): Users can save and
manage their commonly used locations, such as home, work, or other frequently
visited places. This feature streamlines the user experience by providing quick access
to transportation information for these favorite points, facilitating efficient trip
planning.

5. Database on Weather and AQI : The weather and air quality index (AQI) database
functionality stores and manages real-time data on weather conditions and air quality.
This information enhances the user experience by allowing them to factor
environmental conditions into their transportation decisions, promoting
health-conscious and sustainable choices.

6. Security Measures : This functionality focuses on implementing robust security
measures to safeguard user data and ensure the integrity of the platform. Security
features may include encryption of sensitive information, secure user authentication,
and regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

7. Transport Contacts : Users can easily access relevant contacts or links to booking
services for different transport modes. This functionality streamlines the process of
making reservations or obtaining more information about available transportation
options, enhancing the overall user experience.
